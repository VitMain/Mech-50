# Mech50
A 50% ortholinear mechanical keyboard PCB with three extra keys

** PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT ORDER THIS KEYBOARD PCB, IT'S NOT TESTED. SEE NOTES BELOW !! ** 

Update: 14th October 2024

 * Uploaded QMK Firmware

To fix:
========

* rgb wiring is wrong and doesn't work
* Uses the top right pin which makes it less compatible with other microcontrollers
* Still needs a plate
* Needs firmware for KMK / POG
